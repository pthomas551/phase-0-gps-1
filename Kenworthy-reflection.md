1. A concept that really had me stuck was remotes-- both the `remote` command and how remote repos differed from the "regular kind".

2. Remotes were much clearer to me by the end of my GPS, happily! Mostly because I had thought that GitHub repos and remote repos were different things. Merging branches with conflicting commits was demystified for me; the reasoning behind why two branches can't be resolved until their files are identical really solidified.

3. I asked my pair and guide a good amount of questions concerning remote repos, certain command syntaxes, and the function of how commands were strung together (I remember quite a few mentions comparing "origin" and "master"â€” maybe I'll get to "origin/master" next time.)

4. I don't have a solid grasp on git pulls and pushes. I know git pull updates your local repo from its remote location, and git push will force your local commits up to the remote repo. But they still don't act the way I expect in my tests with it. I think that means I need to pay more attention to the timeline of commits I construct.
I still have a hard time visualizing different repos in my computer and treating them as separate entities.

5. My first GPS experience was super positive. I had never paired before, and Phil was a great partner to start with; he had clearly put in the work to have a strong knowledge base for the specific challenge and in general. Morgan, as a guide, was thoughtful, attentive, and sensitive, and still seemed to be having fun as she caught knots in my and Phil's process in the git workflow, or our understanding of a command or concept.
