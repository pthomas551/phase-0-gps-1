What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was still struggling a bit with the concept of merging between different repositories.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

It was helpful to get some more visibility into the pull request process and see how fetching a remote repository from scratch works.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked a lot of questions about syntax and the merge process.

What still confuses you about git?

I feel like I have a good grasp on the core concepts but the commands and syntax will take some time to master.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was fun but a bit stressful since in addition to the exercise you also have to worry about working with your pair and guide over a remote connection.
